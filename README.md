This repository is the companion code to the talk ".NET Aspire: Your DevOps Companion".

In this repository are samples demonstrating the local development experience and developer-focused features of .NET Aspire.

1. `Full`: This is a full-featured demo showing a fully configured .NET Aspire project including a client-side Node.js app written in Vue.js and Vite.

2. `Greenfield`: This project walks through a new project experience, showing off the .NET Aspire starter app.

3. `Brownfield`: This demo shows upgrading an existing .NET app to include .NET Aspire.

4. `Standalone`: The .NET Aspire dashboard can be used as a container outside a .NET project.  This demo shows both containerized and locally debugged apps piping OpenTelemetry data into the .NET Aspire dashboard.
